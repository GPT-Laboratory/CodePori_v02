Given the project description: 
PROJECT_DESCRIPTION: $PROJECT_DESCRIPTION
PROJECT_LANGUAGE: $PROJECT_LANGUAGE

**Coding language and stack-specific guidelines**:
- Select the coding language and tech stack based on the provided project description and language.
- **JavaScript-based projects**:
  - Use the MERN stack or any other appropriate stack as needed.
  - Separate the structure into `client/` and `server/` folders for front-end and back-end code, respectively.
  - Include configuration files such as `package.json` inside `client/` and `server/` if relevant.
  - Ensure database configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `config.json`) are placed appropriately within the `server/` directory.
- **Java-based projects**:
  - Do not include HTML or CSS files.
  - Focus only on Java files and backend logic, structured appropriately.
  - Organize code into packages reflecting different modules or functionalities.
  - Include configuration files for database connections if necessary.
- **Python-based projects**:
  - Include folders like `templates/` and `static/` for Flask or Django applications if needed.
  - Do not include unnecessary files such as `.env`, or `README.md`, unless explicitly required.
  - Ensure configuration files like `config.py` are placed in a dedicated `config/` directory if applicable.
  - Include `requirements.txt` for managing dependencies.
- **Other languages**:
  - Adapt the file structure based on standard practices for the selected language or stack.
  - Include necessary configuration and setup files as per the language's conventions.
  - Ensure database configuration files are included if required.

**Output Requirements**:
- Return a **plain-text tree structure** with the folder and file hierarchy.
- **No JSON or additional commentary**. 
- Include a maximum of **5-10 relevant code files** tailored to the project description.
- **Exclude unnecessary files** like requirements, readme, .env, .gitignore, etc.

**Output format**: (Not to include three backticks in response)
  project_name/
    - app.extension
    - modules/
      - file1.extension
      - file2.extension
      - file3.extension

**Additional Notes**:
- Ensure all file and folder names follow conventions for the chosen language or framework.
- Dynamically adapt to the stack and project-specific requirements, including naming conventions and folder organization.
- For frameworks like Flask/Django, include necessary subdirectories (e.g., `templates/`, `static/`).
- For MERN stack, ensure clear separation between `client/` and `server/` directories.
- Include database configuration files within the appropriate directories based on the tech stack.
- Ensure that the folder structure supports absolute imports to facilitate seamless module integration.
