Context:
- ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW: $ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW
- FLOW_STRUCTURE: $FLOW_STRUCTURE
- MODULE_DESCRIPTION: $MODULE_DESCRIPTION
- ACCUMULATED_CODE: $ACCUMULATED_CODE
- PROJECT_DESCRIPTION: $PROJECT_DESCRIPTION
- LANGUAGE: $LANGUAGE

Goal: Produce **a single code file** for the path in MODULE_DESCRIPTION.

**Instructions**:
1. **Language-Specific Handling**:
   - **JavaScript**:
     - Utilize the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
     - Generate both **front-end** and **back-end** code as required.
     - Include necessary configuration files such as `config.json`, etc.
     - Separate `client/` (frontend) and `server/` (backend) components properly.
     - Ensure `package.json` files for both `client/` and `server/` are generated and accurately configured.
     - Ensure proper integration between front-end and back-end components.
     - Use absolute imports based on the file/folder structure to avoid relative import issues.
     - **Database Connections**:
       - Implement proper database connection handling using ODMs like Mongoose.
       - Ensure secure and efficient connection configurations.

   - **Python**:
     - Use appropriate frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask) based on the project description.
     - Include necessary configuration files like `config.py`, `requirements.txt` and `package.json` (only if specified).
     - Generate both backend (API or logic) and frontend (HTML templates or JS) components if needed.
     - Ensure module imports use absolute paths reflecting the file/folder structure.
     - Generate a proper `requirements.txt` listing all necessary libraries used.
     - **Database Connections**:
       - Implement proper database connection handling using ORMs like SQLAlchemy.
       - Ensure secure and efficient connection configurations.

   - **Java**:
     - Use **Core Java** without creating any HTML or frontend files.
     - Focus solely on backend functionalities, including command-line interfaces.
     - Adhere to object-oriented programming principles and design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory).
     - Ensure that imports are absolute and reflect the file/folder structure accurately.
     - **Database Connections**:
       - Implement proper database connection handling using JDBC or ORM frameworks like Hibernate.
       - Ensure secure and efficient connection configurations.

   - **Other Languages**:
     - Adapt the technology stack based on the selected language (e.g., Spring Boot for Java, Ruby on Rails for Ruby).
     - Include relevant configuration and setup files as per standard practices.
     - Ensure proper import statements and dependency management as per the language's conventions.
     - **Database Connections**:
       - Implement appropriate database connection handling based on the language and framework.
       - Ensure secure and efficient connection configurations.

2. **Module Type Determination**:
   - **Tests**:
     - If `MODULE_DESCRIPTION` indicates tests (e.g., path includes "tests/test_..."), generate unit tests referencing `ACCUMULATED_CODE`.
     - Use testing frameworks appropriate to the LANGUAGE (e.g., Jest for JavaScript, unittest or pytest for Python).
   - **Main/Supporting Code**:
     - Otherwise, generate the main or supporting code file as specified.

3. **Code Generation Guidelines**:
   - **Formatting**:
     - Wrap the final code in triple backticks with the language identifier, e.g.:
       ```$LANGUAGE
       // code here
       ```
   - **File Management**:
     - Do not recreate or overwrite existing files. Only produce new code needed for the specified `MODULE_DESCRIPTION`.
     - Use the `rel_path` specified in `MODULE_DESCRIPTION` for the generated file path, ensuring the code integrates seamlessly.
   - **Best Practices**:
     - Ensure that the code adheres to the best practices and coding standards of the specified LANGUAGE.
     - Maintain seamless integration with the existing codebase provided in `ACCUMULATED_CODE`.
     - Focus primarily on backend logic and functionalities to maintain project efficiency and scalability.
     - For HTML files, ensure that CSS files are correctly linked and that all input fields are properly defined and functional.
     - **Proper Database Connections**:
       - Ensure that the generated code includes proper handling of database connections, using absolute paths and secure configurations.
       - Validate that the database integration aligns with the `ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW`.

4. **Additional Instructions**:
   - **Exclude Unnecessary Files**:
     - Do not create files such as `readme.md`, `.env`, `.gitignore`, unless explicitly required by the LANGUAGE-specific framework.
   - **Configuration Files**:
     - For frameworks or stacks that require configuration files (e.g., `config.json` for MERN), ensure they are properly generated and integrated.
   - **Dynamic Adaptation**:
     - Adjust the code generation process dynamically based on the specified LANGUAGE and its associated technology stack.
   - **File Paths**:
     - Use the `rel_path` specified in `MODULE_DESCRIPTION` for the generated file path, ensuring the code integrates seamlessly.
   - **Import Statements**:
     - Use absolute import statements based on the project's folder structure to prevent import issues, especially in Java and Python.
   - **Database Connection Handling**:
     - Implement secure and efficient database connection handling as per the best practices of the specified LANGUAGE and framework.
     - Ensure that database credentials are securely managed and not hard-coded.

**Important**: 
- Do not include any extra commentary or explanations outside of the generated code.
- Ensure that the code block is correctly formatted and free from syntax errors.
